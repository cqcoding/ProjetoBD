This repository contains the necessary files for the practical assignment of the Databases course from the Informatics Engineering Department at Univeristy of Coimbra. The base code was already provided by the professor. 


## [Python](python) REST API

To start this demo run the script [`python demo-api.py`](demo-api.py). This will launch a local web server with the coded endpoints. You can then make requests to the endpoints through HTTP (e.g., open your web browser and access http://localhost:8080/departments). To organize the interactions with the web server it is best to use an application; for this assignment you must use [`Postman`](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). Postman supports _collections_, which allows you to group requests (such as those that you will have to develop for the practical assignment). You can also import collections (such as the examples provided).
